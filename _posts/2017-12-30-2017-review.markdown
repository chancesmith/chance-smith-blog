## 3 Books a month

This goal was a fail (learning experience). :P

I got stuck on "Bringing Up Boys" for the longest. Dr. Dobson has a ton of examples for parenting, but took such an emotional twol to read the book.

+ "Bringing Up Boys" by Dr. James Dobson
+ "10X Rule" by Grant Cardone
+ "The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up" by Marie Kondo
+ "The End of Jobs: Money, Meaning and Freedom Without the 9-to-5" by Taylor Pearson
+ "The One Minute Manager Meets the Monkey" by Kenneth Blanchard

-----

## Lead a meetup

I had the oppurtunity to lead the [CO:de meetup](http://code.attheco.com). There has been an average of 10 people for each meetup.

I've done *20 videos* for CO:de and some of which have been used for the Dev.Catalyst program.

## Teach coding

This year I have created a workshop for beginner web developers that I've lead 4 times this year to *40+ people*.

-----

## Attend 2 conferences

+ [C4TK](http://codeforthekingdom.org/): Code 4 The Kingdom (won hackathon 2nd year in a row)
+ [Nodevember](http://nodevember.org/) (5th time to attend)
+ singed up for Python conf for 2018 - [PyTN](https://www.pytennessee.org/)

## Mentor new coders

With my solo intro to coding, it was a hard beginning. I was hoping I could encourage others into the industry and share what my experience and knowledge.

The workshops, leading a meetup, and now mentoring a couple members in Sodium Halogen, it's been a good year. I've also been meeting a biology grad from Union University that is wanting to make the switch into developement. We've been meeting weekly for a few hours on Wednesday at 6am. He's been killing it. I've been very very impressed. Keep it up, Zach!

## Unexpected wins

+ went to San Fransico with Dev.Catalyst team and competition winning students üòÆ üëç
+ learned a good bit about cryptocurrencies
+ made a average 13% ROI on each crypto investment with a total of 105% ROI

## Warp up

I recommend everyone set goals and keep track. This has been very insightful.

Now I need to set my goals for year. Join me. üòä
