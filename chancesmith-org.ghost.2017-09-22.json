New Blog: The Seal Breaker","slug":"this-new-blog-the-seal-breaker","markdown":"<p style=\"text-align: left;\">My mind has been bursting at the seams and so has my Evernote account. I have been journaling all my ideas as they have come to me. I feel that in the past if I didn't take note of an idea instantly the ideas would stop coming. My brain would stop producing once I deemed it unimportant to take note of it's work or revelation. I am now at the mercy of my own ideas and productivity and can't let either dissipate or time disappear from me. I have been reading a lot on propper time managment and striving for more and more productivity within the smallest periods of time. I have to admit that this has not been a easy task.</p>\r\nExample: I now only check my email twice a day, spending only one hour total in my inbox instead of every five minutes trying to respond to every seemingly important email. This also includes putting my text and email tones on my phone on silent. Life saver! I feel that alone has decreased my stress and increased my efficiency ten fold. An Auto-Responder in GMail has made this seamless and I have not received any negative feedback from any of my clients, friends or family. If there is a emergency please call me.\r\n\r\nMore of this kind of stuff to come.\r\n\r\nI have recently started two new projects to add to my portfolio of multiple streams of income. Hmm, that sounds way more professional in compared to the amount of excitement I experience and fun I have for each niche.

I want to thank my wife, <a title=\"Molly Smith's Blog\" href=\"http://www.mollysmith.org\" target=\"_blank\">Molly Smith</a>, for all her kind words and encouragement. She has had to listen to me so many times about idea after idea. I hope to bring her some relief soon to her bleeding ears.

Look at the <a title=\"Home\" href=\"http://www.chancesmith.org/\">Home Page</a>.","html":"<p style=\"text-align: left;\">My mind has been bursting at the seams and so has my Evernote account. I have been journaling all my ideas as they have come to me. I feel that in the past if I didn't take note of an idea instantly the ideas would stop coming. My brain would stop producing once I deemed it unimportant to take note of it's work or revelation. I am now at the mercy of my own ideas and productivity and can't let either dissipate or time disappear from me. I have been reading a lot on propper time managment and striving for more and more productivity within the smallest periods of time. I have to admit that this has not been a easy task.</p>  \n\n<p>Example: I now only check my email twice a day, spending only one hour total in my inbox instead of every five minutes trying to respond to every seemingly important email. This also includes putting my text and email tones on my phone on silent. Life saver! I feel that alone has decreased my stress and increased my efficiency ten fold. An Auto-Responder in GMail has made this seamless and I have not received any negative feedback from any of my clients, friends or family. If there is a emergency please call me.</p>\n\n<p>More of this kind of stuff to come.</p>\n\n<p>I have recently started two new projects to add to my portfolio of multiple streams of income. Hmm, that sounds way more professional in compared to the amount of excitement I experience and fun I have for each niche.

I am rather excited! Besides the burning desire to end my summer class I am ready to embark on a few more business ventures, while I continue what I have. I have a few clients that I need to tie up loose ends with on website development. But I have been trying to reach out to a few older clients and help them on further developing the webspace they I helped them construct. So lets start with a few things I started in July and still working on.\r\n\r\n<strong>July 2012</strong>\r\nI am fitting well into the work and school life from home. The remote work I am doing is very very educational. In case you are wondering, I do not work in my pajamas. I wake up and take a shower as usual. I feel I need to get up and get ready like I always did. There is still a great feeling of success when you are dressed for comfort and professionalism. I make a effort to not wear anything too casual though. Something I would workout in or lay out on the couch, if I was even consdered good at that, is not appropriate in my eye. So, here is where my time has been lately.\r\n\r\n<strong>Wolfgang Computer Service </strong>(<a title=\"Wolfgang Computer Service\" href=\"http://www.wolfgangcomputer.com\" target=\"_blank\">Link</a>)\r\nI still take on clients and have been working on websites primarily. My design is still simple and to be less graphic intensive as possible. Minimalistic is a great way to describe what I try to implement. I am still hashing out the major parts of the new website and hope to finish it this month. I am wanting to make the website as helpful as possible by giving instructions to fix common technology issues. I also aim to reduce the amount of calls I receive by placing my hourly rate on the home page. Calls asking my rate and what I do are the larget time wasters and I want to give my time to my customers that value their own time as well.\r\n\r\n<strong>Better Job Landing </strong>(<a title=\"Wolfgang Computer Service\" href=\"http://www.betterjoblanding.com\" target=\"_blank\">Link</a>)\r\nThis has been one of the most exciting ventures thus far! Ideas are constant on how to develop this business but blogging for it has been more difficult. I still enjoy the information and still let leadership material consumes the majority of my education outside of school. I am working on more resources for the growing traffic and subscribers here, for this is my fastest following growth so far.\r\n\r\n<strong>Extra Projects</strong>\r\nI have created this blog and <a title=\"Molly Smith's Blog\" href=\"http://www.mollysmith.org/\" target=\"_blank\">my wife's</a>, but there are two other domains that I have done as well. I don't want to skew the traffic results by revealing their domains but will give you the idea. These two sites are \"niche sites.\" Their main purpose is the gather a crowd of people that are interested in that topic and products and give them the best. The results aren't staggering at all. The primary goal right now is to try this out. My wife has joined me in on this and we have built her own for experimental use. If you wanted to count traffic, she is beating me so far. This has been fun and very educational.\r\n\r\n<strong>Education</strong>\r\nSpeaking of education, I absolutely love to learn. My wife and I always have three books on our nightstands and I always have a slue of podcasts and audio books to listen to. I have been learning and tackling Keyword Research and Search Engin Optimization (SEO) mostly. These skills are important to my customers and for my own sites. I need to be better in what I am doing and this has been huge lately. Again...blah blah.....I have have been working on this summer class and it has taken a good chuck of my mind lately. I will say I learned a lot about my research topic that I had for school, haha. Riveting, I know!\r\n\r\n<strong>Productivity</strong>\r\nThis has ben a focus for me and wanted to push it to the blog. I have had so much trouble of staying focused and having all this time at home. It can sometimes be hard to keep your mind on the project at hand. I have been active in the area of how I can produce the most in the smallest amount of time (speaking of minimalist). Spending time with my wife is important and and building my income at home is the challenge. I am trying to tackle both with great intensity. For the majority of my time I feel I am not in the groove when the best opportunity arises to work or be with my wife. I am much like my mother and hate a regular routine. In my attempts to be productive I have done the following:\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li><strong>eat something for breakfast every morning (within the first 30mins)</strong>\r\nThere is much need in stock piling your morning with high protein food for the body and mind. I know how I run on empty, thumbs down! Be productive by giving yourself the right fuel.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>check email only twice a day</strong>\r\nIt drove me up the wall to look back on my day and notice all I had been doing is responding to email after email. I treat all my emails as urgent and now I do it two times a day. Once right before lunch and once before my wife comes home from work. Try this for two days. Really! Set up two reminders on your phone to check the your emails then. Notice how much time you spend on your email and use your extra time on your current projects. It is too cool! Wait... It's even better when you are doing what you love!</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>silence my phone in all ways except for calls, my ringer is sudden and not something that is going to jolt me.</strong>\r\nThere is so much interruption of my mind every time my phone goes off. I still place a importance to returning texts and calls as fast as possible. I want to make sure that anyone that calls me knows that I take a large effort to get back with them fast. I was very bad about this in the past. I promise if I see it on my phone you are the next thing on my list. A missed message or missed call is a priority pusher.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>write down the 2 things I need to accomplish today and do them first</strong>\r\nYou could have 20 things that you need to do but let us not overwhelm ourselves.

This comes with practiced discipline and so does productivity.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<strong>Books I Read</strong>\r\nI am not impressed with this list and have a few I have already finished this month.

The reason being, it is very dense. \n\n**Warning**: Do Not Buy This Book if You do Not Plan to Act! Dave Ramsey has packaged this information especially well and I can't wait to break out the book again next year for a second time through.\n\nI might have to post the next five things I learned in 6 months. I already could have changed this to the 267 things I learned but I will save your time since my focus is productivity.\n\nTo the point. If you are ready to show everybody, including yourself, what you are really made of, this is the book for you. If you also are ready to bring your leadership and business to a new height and don't know where to start, there are two steps:\n\n* **Step 1**: Quit trying to fix everyone else first! Take huge huge HUGE deep breath and work on you!\n* **Step 2**: After the deep breath...buy this book.\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">Now, my point is not to spoil the gold nuggets of this treasure, but I want to share something that you can apply today. Enjoy and tell me what you think of the book. I would love to hear form you! Cheers!\n\n\nTop Five from: EntreLeadership.\n\n* The amount of character you have will determine whether your team is going to prosper or fail. Break open your integrity and see where you stand with leading a team. You can't get your team to be better than you and expect yourself to stay in your own business. If you think you can lie to your CFO and then desire the truth, from her, about your company your expectations won't ever match up with her performance.

The reason being, it is very dense. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Warning</strong>: Do Not Buy This Book if You do Not Plan to Act! Dave Ramsey has packaged this information especially well and I can't wait to break out the book again next year for a second time through.</p>\n\n<p>I might have to post the next five things I learned in 6 months. I already could have changed this to the 267 things I learned but I will save your time since my focus is productivity.</p>\n\n<p>To the point. If you are ready to show everybody, including yourself, what you are really made of, this is the book for you. If you also are ready to bring your leadership and business to a new height and don't know where to start, there are two steps:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Step 1</strong>: Quit trying to fix everyone else first! Take huge huge HUGE deep breath and work on you!</li>\n<li><strong>Step 2</strong>: After the deep breath...buy this book.\n<div style=\"text-align: left;\">Now, my point is not to spoil the gold nuggets of this treasure, but I want to share something that you can apply today. Enjoy and tell me what you think of the book. I would love to hear form you! Cheers!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Top Five from: EntreLeadership.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The amount of character you have will determine whether your team is going to prosper or fail. Break open your integrity and see where you stand with leading a team. You can't get your team to be better than you and expect yourself to stay in your own business. If you think you can lie to your CFO and then desire the truth, from her, about your company your expectations won't ever match up with her performance. The people you are leading will mock, imitate, learn, follow, and believe everything you do and say.  You write the checks and they are just going to do whatever it takes to keep their butt in the cubical and make you happy.

We fight perfection, overwhelming todo lists, and distractions all day.</p>\n\n<p>\"How\" is more important than \"complete\" or \"completing.\" The path is just as important as the destination.</p>\n\n<p>OK, enough with the proverbs. It is best to tackle one task at a time. Use these scheduled times, you set to work on your task, with intense energy. It's also great to take down ideas about other tasks as you think of them, but do not dwell on them. Just write down your ideas and get back to the project at hand. Try those few ideas on for size and commit the next three to memory.  </p>\n\n<ul>  \n    <li><strong>Nothing Has To Be Perfect-</strong> It will never be complete. Remember that! Come to grips with that. If you want to tweak it later that is OK. Think of your projects as friends. If you cater to their needs when they need you, your friends will give back to you in return. Give yourself a stopping point, either by time or task. Post it! Good enough is OK! Your projects will not do anything if they sit on the shelf. Procrastination = waste of time.</li>\n    <li><strong>Make A List Of Tasks For Today-</strong> Make a list of 2-3 things you need to tackle and put them in your pocket or on your desk. Make it your goal to finish them before you eat lunch. Lunch can be your reward.</li>\n    <li><strong>Stop Interruptions-</strong> Communicate your need for 2.5 hours without interruptions. Let everyone know you are clocking out, so that you can clock in. Emergencies are possible but they should be super rare.</li>\n</ul>  \n\n<p>You'll find the results you want when you get yourself under control. Remember these as you roll through your day.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>Nothing will be perfect but it can be done well.\n\nIf I don't have a todo list for before lunch my day is shot.\n\nI need large amounts of time without distraction to be productive.</blockquote>  \n\n<p><strong>What do you struggle with the most: Perfection, overwhelming ToDo lists, and Distractions?</strong></p>","image":null,"featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":"2012-11-19T06:22:56.000Z","created_by":1,"updated_at":"2012-12-11T03:57:15.000Z","updated_by":1,"published_at":"2012-11-19T06:22:56.000Z","published_by":1,"visibility":"public","mobiledoc":null,"amp":null},{"id":17,"uuid":"47564568-abb2-43b5-9f47-83a434aaeacd","title":"Productivity: One Thing At A Time","slug":"productivity-one-thing-at-a-time","markdown":"There is so much to do this week with work, traveling, family, and Thanksgiving  The one thing to have every morning is a todo list, if we are going to get everything done.

Every customer that comes in gets a sample of a energy drink, protein bar, or some Smoothie King snack.\n\nThe goal of the art work to reveal just enough information to peak the audiences interest, while also letting them save the day in their calendars.\n\nThe event was April 22nd, 2015.\n\nWe offered $1 small Angel Food smoothies from 7-9am and this a ton of retail samples.\n\n##Assets\nWith some help of a [template](http://www.freepik.com/free-vector/designer-s-office-flat-illustration_715197.htm) to speed up the artwork, here are the images we used in the campaign on Facebook and Twitter:\n![](/content/images/2015/04/sk-desk-lights-on-09.png)\n![](/content/images/2015/04/sk-desk-lights-on-03.png)\n![](/content/images/2015/04/sk-desk-lights-on-04-1.png)\n![](/content/images/2015/04/sk-desk-lights-on-05.png)\n![](/content/images/2015/04/sk-desk-lights-on-06.png)\n![](/content/images/2015/04/sk-desk-lights-on-07.png)\n![](/content/images/2015/04/sk-desk-lights-on-08.png)\n![](/content/images/2015/04/sk-desk-lights-on-10.png)\n\nThree days Before Launch we posted images like this:\n![](/content/images/2015/04/sk-desk-lights-on-01-3.png)\n![](/content/images/2015/04/sk-desk-lights-on-01-4.png)\n\n##Campaign Results\nThis was depressing. SK has 278 likes on Facebook and we only reach a little over 400 people with the posts. This makes Facebook's effort evident of how they are monetizing the eyeballs (attention) of their users. If businesses want any attention of their *likers*, they'll have to pay for it.\n\nI agree with Facebook's path, but I personally haven't a first hand experience on how far they had come.\n\n![](/content/images/2015/04/Screenshot-2015-04-23-12-00-49.png)\n\n##Event Results\nWe had 15 people come for $1 smalls. #palmToForehead\n\n![](/content/images/2015/04/palmtoforehead.gif)\n\n##Lessons Learned\n**1 - Let your customers know about upcoming events first hand.**  Don't rely any digital platform do all of the talking. We should have all put in some effort to spread the word.\n\n**2 - Consistency is prince.** If content is king, and conversion is queen, consistency is prince. Did I take that too far? \n\nWe feel our biggest failure might have been that we were not promoting anything on a regular basis. There was no repetition of marketing for any customer to look out for.\n\n**3 - Keep going.**  Go ahead and schedule the next events.\n\n##Accomplishments made\n**1 - Something done.**  It's not that the event was a wash, but that we had an event we could learn from. This event is a plus-one for experience added.\n\n**2 - Teamwork.** We all put our heads together on what would make the event the best it could be. We had thirty smoothies ready and four team members on the clock. Let's just say, we were prepared.

SK has 278 likes on Facebook and we only reach a little over 400 people with the posts. This makes Facebook's effort evident of how they are monetizing the eyeballs (attention) of their users.

We should have all put in some effort to spread the word.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2 - Consistency is prince.</strong> If content is king, and conversion is queen, consistency is prince. Did I take that too far? </p>\n\n<p>We feel our biggest failure might have been that we were not promoting anything on a regular basis. There was no repetition of marketing for any customer to look out for.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3 - Keep going.</strong>  Go ahead and schedule the next events.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"accomplishmentsmade\">Accomplishments made</h2>\n\n<p><strong>1 - Something done.</strong>  It's not that the event was a wash, but that we had an event we could learn from. This event is a plus-one for experience added.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2 - Teamwork.</strong> We all put our heads together on what would make the event the best it could be.
